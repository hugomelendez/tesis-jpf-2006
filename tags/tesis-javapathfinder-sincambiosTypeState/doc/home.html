<h1 align="center">Welcome to the Home of Java PathFinder</h1>

<p>Java PathFinder (JPF) is a system to verify executable Java bytecode
programs. In its basic form, it is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that is
used as an explicit state software model checker, systematically
exploring all potential execution paths of a program to find violations
of properties like deadlocks or unhandled exceptions. Unlike traditional
debuggers, JPF reports the entire execution path that leads to a defect.
JPF is especially well-suited to finding hard-to-test concurrency
defects in multithreaded programs.</p>

<p>While software model checking in theory sounds like a safe and robust
verification method, reality shows that it does not scale well. To make
it practical, a model checker has to employ flexible heuristics and
state abstractions. JPF is unique in terms of its configurability and
extensibility, and hence is a good platform to explore new ways to
improve scalability.</p>

<p>JPF is a pure Java application that can be run either as a standalone
command line tool, or embedded into systems like development
environments. It was mostly developed - and is still used - at the NASA
Ames Research Center. Started in 1999 as a feasibility study for
software model checking, JPF has found its way into academia and
industry, and has even helped detect defects in real spacecraft.</p>

    <li>06/30/06: <b>JPF4, at last!</b> We finally have the revamped
    execution scheme with unified data and scheduling ChoiceGenerators. The
    Java 5.0 compatibility also got a boost. And we started to tackle the
    last missing abstraction - configurable state matching. There are a ton
    of other improvements, so get it, test it, let us know.<b>PLEASE NOTE THAT
    WE SWITCHED THE SOURCE REPOSITORY TO SUBVERSION</b></li>
    
    <li>02/24/06: We are on Frappr! Please join the community at
    http://www.frappr.com/jpfusers</li>
  
    <li>10/21/05: we switch to HTML + CSS + PNG for the documentation. Less
    nice for printing, but at least everybody can now edit/add.</li>
  
    <li>10/07/05: the StateSet interface at work - state matching
    is now done with Peter Dillinger's JenkinsStateSet, which is up
    to 25% faster</li>
  
    <li>09/08/05: the data choice generators make their first appearance.
    Drop Verify.randomX(..) now</li>
