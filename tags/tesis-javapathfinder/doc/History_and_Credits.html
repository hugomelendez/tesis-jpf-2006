  <h1>History and Credits</h1>

  <p>JPF has come a long way from it's beginnings in 1999. Five major
  phases stand out</p>

  <ol>
    <li>1999 Java-to-Promela translator (using</span> <a href=
      "http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html">Spin</a> as the 
      model checker)</li>
      
    <li>2000 JVM / standalone checker</li>

    <li>2003 design and implementation of extension structure</li>
    
    <li>2005 open sourcing of JPF</li>
    
    <li>2006 JPF4 with unified ChoiceGenerators and new execution engine</li>
  </ol>

  <p>During this time, many people and institutions
  have worked on and with JPF. The majority of work is still done
  by the Robust Software Engineering (RSE) group at the NASA Ames
  Research Center. The incomplete list of key contributors (in
  random order) includes:</p>

  <p><a href="http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/people/havelund">Klaus Havelund</a>, who
  had the original idea to create a software model checker based on
  Java.</p>

  <p><a href="http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/people/visser">Willem Visser</a> is
  (together with Corina) the driving force behind the research part
  of JPF. He continues to drive it into exciting new places like
  symbolic model checking and test case generation.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~flerda">Flavio Lerda</a> did
  most of the work for phase 2, turning JPF from a translator into
  a VM</p>

  <p><a href="http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/people/pcorina">Corina Pasareanu</a>
  continues to tweak JPF as a testbed for symbiosis of symbolic and explicit
  state model checking</p>

  <p><a href="http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/people/jpenix">John Penix</a>
  fought through the NASA ranks to make the JPF open sourcing happen,
  not at least succeeding based on his reputation as one of the few
  people who actually have been able to find real defects with
  software model checking</p>

  <p><a href="http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/people/masoud">Masoud Mansouri-Samani</a>
  shielded the developers from configuration and distribution management in
  the dark ages of closed JPF sources</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.schwartz-omalley.com/people/owen">Owen O'Malley</a>
  showed his programming skills by implementing the MD5 based state hashing
  (with an interesting red-black tree), a huge win in terms of state storage.
  Owen also added some java.io library support based on MJI.</p>

  <p><a href="http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/people/dimitra">Dimitra Giannakopoulou</a>
  happily uses JPF to distribute her famous <i>LTL2Buechi</i> - automaton
  translator (e.g. used in the LTSA system), which is so good that it remains
  in the JPF distribution even while JPF's LTL search is currently
  defunct. The translator can be built and used independently from
  the rest of JPF.</p>

  <p><a href="http://ase.arc.nasa.gov/people/mehlitz">Peter Mehlitz</a>
  - the "refactorator", trying to fill the Java holes, coming up with
  extension mechanisms, and getting all this into a manageable
  package</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~peterd/">Peter Dillinger</a>
  is a hacker (the good kind) who has made numerous random
  simplifications, optimizations, bug fixes, code clean-ups and
  migrations for JPF4.  Currently building new, flexible
  infrastructure for matching visited states.</p>
