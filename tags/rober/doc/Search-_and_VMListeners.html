  <h1>Search- and VMListeners</h1>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>

  <p>Beyond this basic Search-VM collaboration, there
  are numerous potential variations, e.g. to gather statistics, to
  monitor the state exploration progress, or to query details of
  states like field values. These are typical tasks for programs
  that use JPF, and add certain functionality on top of it (e.g. a
  graphical user interface). The goal is to provide an extension
  mechanism in JPF that enables adding such functionality without
  modifying Search or VM implementations</p>

  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/jpf-listener.png" /><br>
       Figure 1: Listener pattern</p>

  <p>The required extensibility is achieved by means
  of a Listener pattern (a Observer variant with a wide,
  change-topic specific notification interface), i.e. Listener
  instances register themselves either with the Search and/or the
  VM object (Subject), get notified when their corresponding
  Subjects perform certain operations, and can then interact with
  the Subject to query additional information, or even control the
  successive Subject behavior.</p>

  <p>Changed facets of the Subjects are mapped into
  separate Observer methods, passing in the corresponding Subject
  instance as a parameter. As a implementation detail, Subjects
  keep track of registered listeners via so called MultiCasters
  (linked lists consisting of nodes implementing the listener
  interface), to avoid runtime costs for container traversal, which
  is suitable for high frequent notifications with small numbers of
  listeners.</p>

  <p>Both interfaces reside in the general
  gov.nasa.jpf directory, hence we avoid using parameters which
  expose underlying Search or VM implementation constructs (like
  ThreadInfo etc.), and rely on Listeners residing in the right
  package to access detailed information by casting the Subject to
  its implementation class. In general, we avoid interface methods
  with varying degrees of specialization, i.e. don't provide
  several notifications based on the same event if</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the specialization can be detected by the Listener
    (e.g. method call and instruction execution)</li>

    <li>there is no non-observable symmetric notification, e.g. visible
    object creation (NEW instruction executed), but invisible object
    destruction (garbage collection)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are three different levels of Subject
  information retrieval by listener implementations:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Generic - listener resides outside any JPF
    package and just uses the information that is publicly
    available via gov.nasa.jpf.Search / VM (potentially using other
    gov.nasa.jpf classes and interfaces)</li>
    
    <li>Search-specific - listener resides outside JPF
    packages but casts Subject notification parameter (Search or
    VM) to concrete implementation (e.g.
    gov.nasa.jpf.search.heuristic.BFSHeuristic), using its public
    API to retrieve implementation-specific information</li>

    <li>Internal - listener resides in concrete Subject
    implementation package (e.g. gov.nasa.jpf.jvm), accessing
    package private information</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>SearchListener</h2>

  <p>SearchListener instances are used to monitor the
  state space search process, e.g. to create graphical
  representations of the state-graph. They provide notification
  methods for all major Search actions.</p>

  <p class="code">
public interface SearchListener extends JPFListener {
  
  /* got the next state */
  void stateAdvanced (Search search);
  
  /* state is fully explored */
  void stateProcessed (Search search);
  
  /* state was backtracked one step */
  void stateBacktracked (Search search);

  /* a previously generated state was restored
     (can be on a completely different path) */
  void stateRestored (Search search);
  
  /* JPF encountered a property violation */
  void propertyViolated (Search search);
  
  /* we get this after we enter the search loop,
     but BEFORE the first forward */
  void searchStarted (Search search);
  
  /* there was some contraint hit in the search, we back out
     could have been turned into a property, but usually is an
     attribute of the search, not the application */
  void searchConstraintHit (Search search);
  
  /* we're done, either with or without a preceeding error */
  void searchFinished (Search search);
}</p>
  

  <p >For the standard depth first search
  (gov.nasa.jpf.search.DFSearch), listener implementations can
  assume the following notification model:</p>

  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/DFSListener.png" /><br>
       Figure 2: depth first search notification automaton</p>

  <h2>Example</h2>

  <p>Using this interface, a sample application to log
  a generic search progress can be programmed like this</p>

  <p class="code">
import gov.nasa.jpf.JPF;
import gov.nasa.jpf.Transition;
import gov.nasa.jpf.SearchListener;
import gov.nasa.jpf.Search;

public class TestClient implements SearchListener {
   
  /**************** main entry: driver ***************/

  public static void main (String[] args) {
    TestClient listener = new TestClient();

    Config conf = JPF.createConfig(args);
    // add your own args here..
    conf.setProperty("jpf.print_exception_stack","true");
                     
    JPF jpf = new JPF(conf); 
    jpf.addSearchListener(listener);
     
    System.out.println("---------------- JPF started");
    jpf.run();
    System.out.println("---------------- JPF terminated");
  }
   
  /**************** SearchListener notifications *****/

  public void stateRestored(Search search) {
    log( "restore ", search);
  }

  public void stateBacktracked (Search search) {
    log( "back ", search);
  }

  public void searchStarted (Search search) {
    System.out.println("search started");
  }

  public void searchFinished (Search search) {
    System.out.println(" search finished");
  }

  public void propertyViolated (Search search) {
    ErrorList errors = search.getErrors();

    for (int i=0; i&lt;errors.size(); i++) {
      System.out.println(?property violated: ? +
      errors.getError(i));
    }
  }
  
  public void searchConstraintHit(Search search) {
    System.out.println("constraint hit:" + search.getConstraint();
  }

  public void stateAdvanced (Search search) {
    log( search.hasNextState() ? "&gt; " : "* ", search);
  }
   
  /**************** helper methods *************/

  private void log (String prefix, Search search) {
    Transition trans = search.getTransition();  // acquire last transition

    // (list of executed insns)
    if (trans != null) {
      System.out.print(prefix);
      System.out.print(trans.getThread()); // get current thread number
      System.out.print(" ");
      System.out.print(search.getStateNumber());  // get unique state id
      System.out.print(" ");

      System.out.print(search.getSearchDepth());  // get current search depth
      System.out.print(" : ");

      System.out.println(trans.getLabel());
    }
  }
}</p>

  <p>More elaborate examples of SearchListeners can be
  found in test/gov/nasa/jpf/tools, which also includes
  StateSpaceDot, a generator for GraphViz specific graph
  descriptions (Dot files) to generate state graph images.</p>

  <h2>VMListener</h2>

  <p>VMListeners are used to follow the detailed VM
  processing, e.g. to monitor certain execution environment
  specific instructions (like Java IF instructions for coverage
  analysis, or PUTFIELD, GETFIELD instructions for potential race
  detections).</p>

  <p class="code">
/**
 * interface to register for callbacks by the VM
 * Observer role in equally named pattern
 */
public interface VMListener extends JPFListener {

  /* JVM is about to execute the next instruction */
  void executeInstruction (JVM vm);

  /* VM has executed next instruction
     (can be used to analyze branches, monitor PUTFIELD / GETFIELD and
     INVOKExx / RETURN instructions) */
  void instructionExecuted (JVM vm);
  
  /* new Thread entered run() method */
  void threadStarted (JVM vm);
    
  /* thread is waiting for signal */
  void threadWaiting (JVM vm);

  /* thread got notified */
  void threadNotified (JVM vm);
    
  /* thread got interrupted */
  void threadInterrupted (JVM vm);
  
  /* Thread exited run() method */
  void threadTerminated (JVM vm);

  /* new thread was scheduled by VM */
  void threadScheduled (JVM vm); // might go into the choice generator notifications

  /* new class was loaded */
  void classLoaded (JVM vm);

  /* new object was created */
  void objectCreated (JVM vm);
  
  /* object was garbage collected (after potential finalization) */
  void objectReleased (JVM vm);
  
  /* notify if an object lock was taken (this includes automatic
     surrender during a wait()) */
  void objectLocked (JVM vm);
  
  /* notify if an object lock was released (this includes automatic
     reacquisition after a notify()) */
  void objectUnlocked (JVM vm);
  
  /* notify if a wait() is executed */
  void objectWait (JVM vm);
  
  /* notify if an object notifies a single waiter */
  void objectNotify (JVM vm);

  /* notify if an object notifies all waiters */
  void objectNotifyAll (JVM vm);
  
  /* garbage collection cycle started */
  void gcBegin (JVM vm);
  
  /* garbage collection cycle finished */
  void gcEnd (JVM vm);
  
  /* exception was thrown */
  void exceptionThrown (JVM vm);
}</p>

  <p>VMListeners usually do reside in JPF implementation packages, and
  are mainly intended to be a internal, non-intrusive JPF extension
  mechanism, e.g. to provide additional information for specific
  Search implementations. The reason for this restriction is that
  VM is a very coarse abstraction of its potential implementors,
  and we do not want to "bubble up" abstration types of execution
  environment specific classes into the common gov.nasa.jpf
  package.</p>

  <h2>Configuration</h2>

  <p>Listener configuration can be done in two ways:
  (1) per configuration file, and (2) dynamic:</p>

  <p><b>(1) configuration file</b> - the property 'jpf.listener' can be used
  to specify a colon separated list of listener class names:</p>

  <p class="code">
jpf.listener=x.y.MyFirstListener:x.z.MySecondListener</p>

  <p>The type of registration (SearchListener and/or VMListener) depends on
  the interfaces that are implemented by the specified classes. If a class
  implements both interfaces, the same instance will be registered automatically
  as a Search- and a VMListener.</p>

  <p><b>(2) dynamic configuration</b> - is usually done by applications
  that run JPF embedded:</p>

   <p class="code">
MyListener listener= new MyListener(..);
..
Config config = JPF.createConfig( args);
JPF jpf = new JPF( config);
jpf.addSearchListener(listener);
jpf.addVMListene( listener);
jpf.run();
..</p>

  <p>Most listeners tend to fall into three major
  categories: (a) system class (e.g. for logging), (b) complex
  properties, and (c) JPF debugging. The first category (a) is
  usually configured via the default.properties, (b) is configured
  with an application specific mode property file, (c) is specified
  via the command line ('+key=value' overrides).</p>
