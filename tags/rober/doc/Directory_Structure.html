  <h1>Directory Structure</h1>

  <p>The JPF directory tree is divided into two
  categories: sources and binaries. Sources do not only contain the
  core JPF classes, but also standard library abstractions used by
  JPF, this HTML documentation, and a regression test suite. Binaries
  include the JPF class files, and (optionally) required 3rd party libraries
  and build-tools.</p>

       Figure 1: JPF directory structure</p>

  <p>To enable builds of JPF outside an integrated
  development environment, the JPF distribution contains an
  optional directory tree that contains everything that is required
  to compile JPF sources from a command line. Using these tools, a
  build directory is created that holds the class files for the
  three major source directories.</p>

  <p>The lib directory contents are required to run
  JPF, and need to be in the CLASSPATH if JPF is started directly,
  i.e. without the provided scripts.</p>

  <p>To ease JPF execution, the bin directory contains
  scripts to automatically set the CLASSPATH. The script bin/jpf
  can be used to start JPF from the command line like a normal Java
  VM (i.e. is a java drop-in replacement).</p>
