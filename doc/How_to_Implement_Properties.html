  <h1>How to Implement Properties</h1>

  <p>There are three general types of property checks that can be
  performed with JPF: (1) ordinary assertions, (2) gov.nasa.jpf.Property based,
  and (3) gov.nasa.jpf.SearchListener or gov.nasa.jpf.VMListener based.</p>

  <p><b>(1) Java assertions</b> inside the application under test
  are the most straight forward way to test simple safety properties
  that only depend on test application data values (e.g. parameter value
  intervals). Violations (AssertionErrors) are caught be JPF's generic
  NoUncaughtExceptionProperty. The drawback of this method is that it
  requires access to the test application sources, and that it can
  significantly increase the state space if the property requires
  evaluation state itself (e.g. for properties implemented as automatons)</p>

  <p><b>(2) gov.nasa.jpf.Property</b> instances are used to
  encapsulate property checks. These instances can be configured
  statically (via the search.properties setting) or dynamically
  (via jpf.getSearch().addProperty()), and are checked by the
  Search object after each transition. In case a Property.check(..)
  method implementation returns false, and termination has been
  requested, the search process is ended, and all violated
  properties are printed (which potentially includes error
  traces)</p>

  <p>JPF comes with the following generic Property classes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.NotDeadlockedProperty - for every non-end
    state, test if there is any runnable threadleft</li>

    <li>gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.NoAssertionViolatedProperty - test if any
    assertion expression has been violated</li>

    <li>gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.NoUncaughtExceptionsProperty - test if any
    exception was not handled inside the application</li>
  </ul>

  <p>New properties can be added by providing additional
  implementors of the gov.nasa.jpf.Property interface</p>

  <p class="code">
  public interface Property extends Printable {
    boolean check (Search search, VM vm);
    String getErrorMessage();
  }</p>

  <p>or, to save some efforts mostly associated with printing out
  error traces, by deriving classes from
  gov.nasa.jpf.GenericProperty, which requires only the check(..)
  method to be overriden. To configure these new checks, add them
  to the colon separated list of classnames specified under
  search.properties in a JPF configuration file (either default or
  mode specific):</p>

  <p class="code">
  search.properties=\
    gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.NotDeadlockedProperty:\
    gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.NoAssertionViolatedProperty:\
    gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.NoUncaughtExceptionsProperty:\
    x.y.z.MyNewProperty</p>

  <p><b>(3) gov.nasa.jpf.SearchListener and
  gov.nasa.jpf.VMListener</b> instances can be used to implement
  more complex checks that do require more information than what is
  available after a transition got executed. The rich set of
  callbacks enables listeners to monitor almost all JPF operations
  and translate them into internal state. JPF execution control can
  be achieved in two ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>by implementing both the appropriate listener interface and
    the gov.nasa.jpf.Property interface, then registering with
    Search.addProperty(..), to let JPF automatically check for
    violated property termination between states.</li>

    <li>by calling Search.terminate() to stop searching for new
    states. This can be done from anywhere within the listener, but
    does not automatically create error reports, which have to be
    done explicitly by the listener.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>To ease property creation, JPF includes a
  <b>gov.nasa.jpf.PropertyListenerAdapter</b> class, which can be
  used as base class for complex properties. Subclasses only have to
  implement the interface methods they are interested in, property
  registration is performed automatically during the SearchListener.searchStarted
  notification. The typical design for such a subclass is to use VMListener
  methods to determine when the property fails, and then store this
  condition in a field which is evaluated in the Property.check() method.</p>
  
  <p class="code">
public class MyPropertyListener extends PropertyListenerAdapter {
  boolean propertyHolds = true;
  ..
  
  /********************** Property interface **************/
  public boolean check (Search search, VM vm) {
    return propertyHolds;
  }
  
  public String getErrorMessage () {    
    return "My property violated " + ...;
  }
  
  /********************** VMListener interface *************/
  public void instructionExecuted (VM vm) {
    JVM jvm = (JVM)vm;
    Instruction insn = jvm.getLastInstruction();
    
    if (insn instanceof ...) {
       .. propertyHolds = false; ..
    }
  }
}</p>

  <p>Examples of complex properties following this scheme can be
  found in directory src/gov/nasa/jpf/tools (e.g. RaceDetector).
  Note that JPF might still execute instructions after the
  property failure was detected, since the check() method is
  only called after the transition is completed.</p>
  
  
  <p>Registration is performed via the jpf.listener property, either
  via command line</p>
  <p class="code">
  &gt; bin/jpf .. +jpf.listener=MyPropertyListener ..</p>
  
  <p>or the mode property file (e.g. jpf.properties)</p>
  <p class="code">..
  jpf.listener = ..:MyListener:..</p>
