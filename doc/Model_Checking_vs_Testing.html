  <h1>Model Checking vs. Testing</h1>

  <p>What can JPF do that cannot be achieved with
  normal testing? JPF can simulate non-determinism. Certain aspects
  like scheduling sequences cannot be controlled by a test driver,
  and require help from the execution environment (VM). Other
  sources of non-determinism like random input data are supported
  with special APIs which can significantly ease the creation of
  test drivers. Simulating non-determinism requires more than just
  the systematic generation of all non-deterministic choices. Two
  capabilities come into play to make this work: backtracking and
  state matching.</p>

  <p><b>(1) Backtracking</b> means that JPF can restore previous
  execution states, to see if there are unexplored choices left.
  For instance, if JPF reaches a program end state, it can walk
  backwards to find different possible scheduling sequences that
  have not been executed yet. While this theoretically can be
  achieved by re-executing the program from the beginning,
  backtracking is a much more efficient mechanism if state storage
  is optimized</p>

  <p><b>(2) State Matching</b> is another key mechanism to avoid
  unnecessary work. The execution state of a program mainly
  consists of heap and thread-stack snapshots. While JPF executes,
  it checks every new state if it already has seen an equal one, in
  which case there is no use to continue along the current
  execution path, and JPF can backtrack to the nearest non-explored
  non-deterministic choice</p>

  <p>In theory, explicit state model checking is a
  rigorous method - all choices are explored, if there is any
  defect, it will be found. Unfortunately, software model checking
  can only provide this rigor for reasonably small programs
  (usually &lt;10,000 loc), since the number of states rapidly
  exceeds computational limits for complex programs. This problem
  is known as state space explosion, and can be easily illustrated
  by the number of possible scheduling sequences for a given number
  of processes consisting of atomic sections.</p>

  <p>JPF addresses this scalability problem in three
  ways: (1) configurable search strategies, (2) reducing the number
  of states, and (3) reducing state storage costs.</p>

  <p><b>(1) Configurable search strategies</b> try to solve the problem that the
  whole state space cannot be searched by directing the search so
  that defects are found quicker, i.e. with less computational
  resources. This basically means to use the model checker not as a
  'proof-', but as a 'debugging-' tool, which is mostly achieved by
  using heuristics to order and filter the set of potential
  follow-on states according to some property related relevance.
  Computation of heuristic values is delegated to a user configured
  class, i.e. is not hardcoded in the JPF core</p>

  <p><b>(2) Reducing the number of states</b> that have to be stored is the
  preferred way to improve scalability, and is supported by a
  number of mechanisms</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Heuristic Choice Generators</b> means the set of choices in a
    certain state does not have to be complete. Consider a
    non-deterministic input float value with a threshold behavior.
    The float type makes it impossible to generate all possible
    values anyways, but in terms of checking the system behavior it
    might be sufficient to try only three choices: less than,
    equal, and greater than the threshold. The important capability
    is to make these heuristics configurable so that they can be
    easily extended or adapted to specific application
    needs.</li>

    <li><b>Partial Order Reduction</b> is the most important mechanism
    to reduce the state space in concurrent programs. The goal is to only
    consider context switches at operations that can have effects across
    thread boundaries, like PUTFIELD instructions on objects that are
    accessible from different threads. The challenge is to do this
    on-the-fly, without requiring error-prone user instrumentation.
    JPFs partial order reduction makes use of the Java bytecodes,
    and reachability information obtained from the garbage
    collector, to achieve this</li>

    <li><b>Host VM Execution</b> - JPF is a JVM that is written in Java,
    i.e. it runs on top of a host VM. For components that are not
    property-relevant, it makes sense to delegate the execution from the
    state-tracked JPF into the non-state tracked host VM. The corresponding
    Model Java Interface (MJI) mechanism is especially suitable to handle
    IO simulaion and other standard library
    functionality.</li>

    <li><b>State Abstraction</b> - per default, JPF stores all heap,
    stack and thread changes, which is sometimes a huge overhead if it
    comes to deciding whether two execution states differ from the
    perspective of a certain application. For example, state matching
    based on shape analysis of data structures can yield significant state
    reduction, and has been successfully used in recent JPF
    applications</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>(3) Reducing state storage</b> costs refers mainly to
  implementation features of the JPF core. While not being the
  primary measure to deal with state space explosion, efficient
  state storage is mandatory for a software model checker. Since
  state transitions usually result in a small amount of changes
  (e.g. a single stack frame), JPF uses a technique called state
  collapsing to bring down the per-state memory requirements by
  storing indexes into state-component specific pools (hash tables)
  instead of directly storing changed values</p>

  <p>To compare states, JPF extends the state
  collapsing mechanism by hashing the resulting pool-index vectors,
  using a single, consecutive number as a unique state-id, thus
  reducing state equality checks to single integer comparisons. The
  hash mechanism (state set implementation instead of hash table)
  is configurable, using MD5 as default. The 128 bit hash values
  make it much more likely to run out of state memory before ever
  encountering a hash collision.</p>
