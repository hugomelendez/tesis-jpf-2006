  <h1>The State of Affairs</h1>

  <p>JPF is now in its fifth year of active
  development, but is still a moving target. There are a number of
  ongoing and planned areas of work:</p>

  <p><b>(1) Structural cleanup</b> - JPF started as a
  research tool, and has seen many contributors with different
  goals over time. As a result, its internal structure still needs
  to be re-factored, especially with respect to encapsulation of
  core classes that are related to state management. There are
  still too many remaining direct field accesses.</p>

  <p><b>(2) Enhanced extensibility</b> - while three major
  extension mechanisms (Listeners, MJI and ChoiceGenerators) are already in
  place, application- and property- specific state abstractions still need
  to be done.</p>
  <p>In many cases, state hashing based on complete heap and thread
  information is too expensive or not even suitable
  (over-approximation) to identify property relevant execution
  paths. The complete state is only required for backtracking
  purposes, but not to prune "visited" parts of the state graph.
  Implementing a suitable interface to generate state abstractions
  (e.g. based on data structure shapes) still remains to be done.</p>

  <p><b>(3) Library abstractions</b> - JPF executes bytecode,
  i.e. analyses not only the application under test, but also all
  library code used by it, which often significantly exceeds the
  application size. For many properties, library code is not of
  interest, and should not be state tracked. The Model Java
  Interface (MJI) provides a suitable mechanism to replace real
  library code with abstractions that can be executed outside of
  the JPF VM, e.g. to model IO operations. Using MJI to abstract
  standard Java libraries is a major step towards applying JPF to
  real Java production code.</p>

  <p><b>(4) Execution cost and time model</b> - in its
  current state, JPF does not model time, which is a prerequisite
  to adapt JPF to Realtime Java. In order to introduce time,
  execution costs need to be approximated. This can be done in
  various degrees of fidelity (interpreter, JIT, AOT), and needs to
  be adaptable to different target platforms (architectures, OSes),
  and hence should be kept outside of the JPF kernel, using VM
  listeners that monitor bytecode execution to compute and store
  time as a state-extension. First prototypes of corresponding
  listeners have already been implemented.</p>
