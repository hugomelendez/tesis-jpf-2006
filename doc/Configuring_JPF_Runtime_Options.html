  <h1>Configuring JPF Runtime Options</h1>

  <p>Since JPF is an open system that can be
  parameterized and extended in a variety of ways, there is a
  strong need for a general configuration mechanism. The challenge
  for this mechanism is that many of the parts which are subject to
  parameterization are configured themselves (i.e. classes
  instantiated via classname parameters).</p>
  
  <p>This effectively prohibits the use of a configuration object that
  contains concrete fields to hold configuration data, since this class
  would be a central "design bottleneck" for a potentially open
  number of concrete JPF components like Search, Heuristic and
  Scheduler implementations.</p>
  
  The goal is to have a configuration object that 
  <ul>
      <li>is based on symbolic values</li>
      <li>can be extended at will</li>
      <li>is passed down in a hierarchical initialization
      process so that every component extracts only its own
      parameters.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/jpf-config.png" /><br>
       Figure 1: JPF configuration</p>

  <p>The JPF configuration process uses a
  java.util.Property subclass to achieve this. This property
  instance is initialized in three steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Default Properties are taken from a
    default.properties file residing in the JPF root directory, or
    - if there is no such file - from a resource loaded via the
    gov.nasa.jpf.JPF class itself. This is usually the biggest
    file/resource, and contains many settings that are seldom
    changed for normal usage</li>
    
    <li>Mode Properties are taken from a
    jpf.properties file in the JPF root directory, or a
    correspoding resource loaded via gov.nasa.jpf.JPF if the file
    is non-existent. A mode property file can also be explicitly
    specified via the -c &lt;config-file&gt; command line option.
    Mode properties are usually small, mainly containing the
    classnames of specialized Search and Heuristics classes and
    their respective parameters</li>
    
    <li>Command Line Properties are overlayed on
    top of the mode properties, to conveniently modify single
    parameters without the need to change default or mode property
    files. Command line properties are specified using a
    +&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt; notation, and are mostly used during
    development and testing of new components</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The resulting property object only holds
  key/value pairs with String values. It is an instance of
  gov.nasa.jpf.Config, a utility class that especially contains
  methods to conveniently instantiate objects from String values,
  and has separate accessors for optional and mandatory entries. In
  case of instantiation errors or missing mandatory entries, a
  gov.nasa.jpf.Config.Exception is thrown.</p>

  
  <p>The Config object instantiates configured classes
  with the following constructor lookup scheme</p>

  <ol>
    <li>using parameter types and values that were
    explicitly specified in the instance request</li>

    <li>if no such constructor is found, or no
    parameters were specified, it looks up a
    &lt;classname&gt;(Config) constructor, and passes itself as
    parameter</li>

    <li>if no such constructor is found, it uses a
    default constructor</li>

    <li>if no default constructor is found, a
    Config.Exception is raised</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The method to request a configured instance can
  also use an optional type parameter to guarantee type conformance
  of the created instance, and raise a Config.Exception in case the
  instance does not satisfy this type constraint.</p>

  <p>In some cases, it is not sufficient to get back an object of
  a specific type. If object identity is required, the lookup key can be
  augmented with an <tt>"..@&lt;id&gt;"</tt> suffix:
  
  <p class="code">MyObject mySharedObject = 
                      config.getInstance("myproperty<u>@singleton</u>", MyObject.class);</p>
  
  In this case, Config first checks if it has an entry stored under
  <tt>&lt;id&gt;</tt> in an internal hashtable, and if it does, returns this
  instance (subject to the same type checks). If there is no entry yet, it
  creates an object according to the rules stated above and stores it under
  the <tt>&lt;id&gt;</tt> key. This mechanism is particularly useful to
  implement singletons, i.e. objects that are shared by several clients so that
  the object can store state across all client requests.<p>
  
  <p>The Config object itself is created by
  gov.nasa.jpf.JPF (the main application class), and - by using its
  API to instantiate configured classes - is passed down in a
  hierarchical initialization process so that every class that is
  instantiated has access to it. Instantiated objects can then
  retrieve their corresponding parameters, and optionally transform
  and store them in more specialized representations (e.g. int or
  boolean fields).</p>

  <p>For a detailed description of standard
  properties, see the comments in jpf.properties. The following
  keys stand out as being application and program property
  specific:</p>

  <p><b>vm.classpath</b> - colon separated list
  of directories that are used by JPF to load classes required by
  the application under test. If a class is not found there, the
  standard CLASSPATH is searched too.</p>

  <p><b>vm.sourcepath</b> - corresponding list of
  directories that are searched for sources (in case JPF reports an
  error)</p>

  <p><b>search.class</b> - fully qualified class
  name of the Search class to use</p>

  <p><b>jpf.listener</b> - colon separated list
  of classnames that are used to instantiate Search- and
  VMListeners</p>
