<h1>To Do List</h1>

<p>JavaPathFinder is still a moving target. This is a list of things
that are in the works, or should be from our point of view. Feel free to
add suggestions (via the mailing list), or grab one of the topics and do
it. Let us know (via the
<a href="mailto:javapathfinder-devel@lists.sourceforge.net"> developer
mailing list</a>), so that we can publish this here and avoid
re-inventing the wheel.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>refactor, refactor, refactor</b> - This is mainly about
getting a minimal sense of encapsulation into the core classes, which still
have way too many leftover (chained) direct field accesses<br>
[Peter &lt;sigh&gt;]</li>

<li><b>Eclipse integration</b> - this is in the works, and we will
soon have a basic Eclipse plugin extension. However, developing a suitable
user interface for JPF is definitely a topic that will stay with us for
a long time.</li>

<li><b>library abstractions</b> - we need to abstract the standard
libraries, esp. java.io and java.net. This is an MJI application</li>

<li><b>Debug replacement</b> - there already is a java.util.logging based
infrastructure in place that should be used to replace all references of
the deprecated java.util.Debug. There are a lot of references though..<br>
[Peter &lt;sigh&gt;]</li>

<li><b>state management streamlining</b> - separation of SystemState /
KernelState really doesn't make much sense anymore, once the Scheduler
is externalized. There are also too many places referring to various
parts of JPFs internal state (path, backtrack stack etc.). This is now
in the works as an extension</li>

<li><b>symbolic execution framework</b> - was almost there, but we have
to replace a proprietary library</li>

</ul>
