  <h1>What can be checked with JPF</a></h1>

  <p><i>Which defects can be found by JPF?</i> Out of the box, JPF
  can search for deadlocks and unhandled exceptions (e.g.
  NullPointerExceptions and AssertionErrors), but the user can
  provide own property classes, or write listener-extensions to
  implement other property checks. A number of such extensions,
  like race condition and heap bounds checks are included in the
  JPF distribution</p>

  <p><i>What programs can be checked by JPF?</i> In general, JPF is
  capable of checking every Java program that does not depend on
  unsupported native methods. The JPF VM cannot execute platform
  specific, native code. This especially imposes a restriction on
  what standard libraries can be used from within the application
  under test. While it is possible to write these library versions
  (especially by using the Model Java Interface - MJI mechanism)
  there is currently no support for java.awt, java.net, and only
  limited support for java.io and Java's runtime reflection.
  Another restriction is given by JPF's state storage requirements,
  which effectively limits the size of checkable applications to
  ~10kloc (depending on their internal structure) if no application
  and property specific abstractions are used. Because of these
  library and size limitations, JPF so far has been mainly used for
  applications that are models, but require a full procedural
  programming language. JPF is especially useful to verify
  concurrent Java programs, due to its systematic exploration of
  scheduling sequences - an area which is particularly difficult
  for traditional testing.</p>
