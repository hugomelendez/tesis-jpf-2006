  <h1>Instrumenting Applications with Verify</h1>

  <p>Ideally, JPF can be used to verify arbitrary Java
  applications, but often, these applications are Java models of
  other systems. In this case, it can be helpful to call JPF APIs
  from within the application, to obtain information from JPF or
  direct its further execution. The JPF API is centralized in the
  gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.Verify class, which includes methods from the
  following major categories:</p>

  <p><b>(1) Non-deterministic data choice generators</b> are about to become
   the major API category, which is suitable
  for writing test drivers that are model checker aware. The idea
  is to obtain non-deterministic input data values from JPF in a
  way that it can systematically analyze all relevant choices. In its
  most simple form, this can be used like
  
  <p class="code">// test driver code
import gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.Verify;
..
boolean cond = Verify.getBoolean();
// following code is executed for both cond=true AND cond=false
..</p>

  <p>But non-deterministic choice generators don't stop at value
  sets that can be completely enumerated based on their type
  (like boolean, and - at least theoretically - integers). JPF
  also supports configured heuristics based choice generators,
  where the values sets are application dependent and can be
  specified in property files.
  
  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/choicegen-example.png"><br>
                Figure 1: choice generators</p>

  <p>Heuristic choice generator implementation is described in a
  separate section of this documentation.</p>

  <p><b>(2) Search pruning</b> is useful for highly application
  specific properties, where it is obvious that certain values are
  not of interest with respect to the property.</p>

  <p class="code">// ..compute some data..
Verify.ignoreIf(data &gt; someValue); // prune search if true
// ..do some stuff with data..</p>

  <p>If the provided expression evaluates to true, JPF does not
  continue to execute the current path, and backtracks to the
  previous non-deterministic choice point.</p>


  <p><b>(3) State annotation</b> - based on certain value combinations,
   an application might give
  JPF hints about the relevance of a program state that can be
  subsequently used by Search and/or Heuristic
  implementations.</p>

  <p class="code">// ..compute some data
Verify.interesting( data &lt; someValue );
// ..do some stuff with data</p>

  <p>This does not stop execution by JPF, but stores
  an 'interesting' attribute for the current state. Its more
  general version is used to attach arbitrary strings to
  states:</p>

  <p class="code">// ..compute some data
if (data &lt; someValue) {
  Verify.setAnnotation("critical data value");
  // ..do some stuff with dat</p>

  <p>Again, this category is about to become less important since
  Search- and VMListeners are superior mechanisms to store not just
  strings, but arbitrary objects as state annotations.</p>

  <p><b>(4) Verification log output</b> - this is the most
  simple category, which is used to differentiate
  between normal program output (that is executed and analyzed by
  JPF), and output that is strictly verification relevant, i.e.
  should not appear when executing a program outside JPF. Not very
  surprising, it contains a number of print(..) methods.</p>

  <p><b>(5) Explicit atomicity control</b> - this category can be used to
  control the number of thread interleavings JPF has to analyze.
  While this is problematic in terms of missing potential defects,
  it is was often the only way to constrain the state space so that JPF
  could verify a given application.</p>

  <p class="code">Verify.beginAtomic();
...
// all code in here is executed by JPF in one transition
...
Verify.endAtomic();</p>

  <p>Direct atomicity control was mainly used before the automatic,
  on-the-fly partial order reduction (POR) was implemented, and
  only remains relevant for applications that are (still)
  problematic with respect to POR. This especially includes
  frequent access to reachable, but not visible fields in
  concurrent programs (i.e. there is a reference chain that makes
  the object reachable from different threads, but the
  corresponding fields are private or protected, hence not visible
  for all threads). In general, the role of explicit atomicity
  control will be further reduced by future POR extensions, and
  might in fact be dropped in future releases.</p>

  <p>JPF's on-the-fly POR implementation is described in a separate
  section of this documentation.</p>

  <p><b>(6) Other</b>, more exotic Verify methods support
  collecting information during JPF execution, which is persistent
  and can be later-on queried by JPF embedding code (programs that
  execute JPF). This uses an MJI trick where the native peer class
  (JPF_gov_nasa_jpf_jvm_Verify) is used to set some data during JPF
  execution, which can be later-on retrieved by model class
  (gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.Verify) code that is executed outside of JPF.
  This is currently used to implement counters, which in turn are
  used to verify JPF itself.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that while most of the Verify
  APIs have alternative implementations that enable execution
  outside of JPF, applications using them at least don't build
  outside the JPF environment. Their use therefore is only
  recommended for JPF specific test drivers.</p>
