  <h1>On-the-fly Partial Order Reduction</h1>

  <p>The number of different scheduling combinations
  is the prevalent factor for the state space size of concurrent
  programs. Fortunately, for most practical purposes it is not
  necessary to explore all possible instruction interleavings for
  all threads. The number of scheduling induced states can be
  significantly reduced by grouping all instruction sequences in a
  thread that cannot have effects outside this thread itself,
  collapsing them into a single transition. This technique is
  called Partial Order Reduction (POR), and typically results in
  more than 70% reduction of state spaces.</p>

  <p>JPF employs an on-the-fly POR that does not rely
  on user instrumentation or static analysis. JPF automatically
  determines at runtime which instructions have to be treated as
  state transition boundaries. If POR is enabled (configured via
  vm.por property), a forward request to the VM executes all
  instructions in the current thread until one of the following
  conditions is met:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>the next instruction is scheduling relevant</li>

    <li>the next instruction yields a "nondeterministic" result (i.e.
    simulates random value data acquisition)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Detection of both conditions are delegated to the instruction object
  itself (<tt>Instruction.execute(..)</tt>), passing down information about
  the current VM execution state and threading context. If the instruction
  is a transition breaker, it creates a
  <a href="ChoiceGenerators.html" target="content">ChoiceGenerator</a> and
  schedules itself for re-execution.</p>

  <p class="code">executeStep () {
  ..
  do {
    if ((nextPc = executeInstruction()) == pc) {
      break;
    } else {
      pc = nextPc;
    }
    ..
  } while (pc != null);
  ..
}</p>

  <p>Each bytecode instruction type corresponds to a concrete
  gov.nasa.jpf.Instruction subclass that determins scheduling
  relevance based on the following factors:</p>

  <p><b>Instruction Type</b> - due to
  the stack based nature of the JVM, only about 10% of the Java
  bytecode instructions are scheduling relevant, i.e. can have
  effects across thread boundaries. The interesting instructions
  include direct synchronization (monitorEnter, monitorexit,
  invokeX on synchronized methods), field access (putX, getX),
  array element access (Xaload, Xastore), and invoke calls of
  certain Thread (start(), sleep(), yield(), join()) and Object
  methods (wait(), notify()).</p>

  <p><b>Object Reachability</b> - besides direct synchronizatio
  instructions, field access is the
  major type of interaction between threads. However, not all putX
  / getX instructions have to be considered, only the ones
  referring to objects that are reachable by at least two threads
  can cause data races. While reachability analysis is an expensive
  operation, the VM already performs a similiar task during garbage
  collection, which is extended to support POR.</p>

  <p><b>Thread and Lock Information</b> -
  even if the instruction type and the object reachability suggest
  scheduling relevance, there is no need to break the current
  transition in case there is no other runnable thread. In
  addition, lock acquisition and release (monitorenter,
  monitorexit) do not have to be considered as transition
  boundaries if there they happen recursively - only the first and
  the last lock operation can lead to rescheduling.</p>

  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/por-scheduling-relevance.png" /><br>
       Figure 1: scheduling relevance filters</p>

  <p>While JPF uses these informations to
  automatically deduce scheduling relevance, there exist three
  mechanisms to explicitly control transition boundaries (i.e.
  potential thread interleavings)</p>

  <p><b>Attributor</b> - a configurable
  concrete class of this type is used by JPF during class loading
  to determine object, method and field attributes of selected
  classes and class sets. The most important attributes with
  respect to POR are method atomicity and scheduling relevance
  levels: (a) never relevant, (b) always scheduling relevant, (c)
  only relevant in the context of other runnables. (d) only
  relevant of toplevel lock. The default Attributor executes
  all java.* code atomically, which is can be too aggressive
  (i.e. can cause BlockedAtomicExceptions).</p>

  <p><b>VMListener</b> - a listener can
  explicitly request a reschedule by calling ThreadInfo.yield() in
  response of a instruction execution notification.</p>

  <p><b>Verify</b> - the Verify class
  serves as an API to communicate between the test application and
  JPF, and contains beginAtomic(), endAtomic() functions to control
  thread interleaving</p>

  <p>The main effort of JPFs POR support relates to
  extending its precise mark and sweep collector. POR reachability
  is a subset of collector reachability, hence the mechanism
  piggybacks on the mark phase object traversal. It is complicated
  by the fact that certain reference chains exist only in the
  (hidden) VM implementatiion layer. For instance, every thread has
  a reference to its ThreadGroup, and the ThreadGroup objects in
  turn have references to all included threads, hence - from a
  garbage collection perspective - all threads within a group are
  mutually reachable. If the application under test does not use
  Java reflection and runtime queries like thread enumeration, POR
  reachability should follow accessibility rules as closely as
  possible. While JPF's POR does not yet support protected and
  private access modifiers, it includes a mechanism to specify that
  certain fields should not be used to promote POR reachability.
  This attribute is set via the configured Attributor at class load
  time.</p>

  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/por-mark.png"><br>
       Figure 2: GC based reachability analysis mark phase</p>
       
  <p>With this mechanism, calculating POR reachability becomes a
  straight forward approach that is divided into two phases. Phase 1
  non-recursively marks all objects of the root set (mostly static
  fields and thread stacks), recording the id of the referencing thread.
  In case an object is reachable from a static field, or from two
  threads, it's status is set to shared. Phase 2 recursively traverses
  all heap objects, propagating either a set shared status or the
  referencing thread id through all reference fields that are not marked
  as reachability firewalls. Again, if the traversal hits an object that
  is already marked as referenced by another thread, it promotes the
  object status to shared, and from there propagates the shared status
  instead of the thread id.</p>

  <p>To further reduce irrelevant context switches, JPF can check for
  lock protection to determine if a field access is scheduling relevant.
  If the property <tt>vm.por.sync_detection</tt> is set to <tt>true</tt>,
  JPF looks for potential lock candidates when analyzing GET_x/SET_x instructions.
  The policy of detecting lock candidates is configurable with the property
  <tt>vm.por.fieldlockinfo.class</tt>, the default
  <tt>gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.StatisticFieldLockInfo</tt> just defers the decision
  by recording the set of locks held when executing the field instruction,
  computing the set intersection at subsequent accesses. If the set does
  not get empty for a configurable number of field accesses, the field
  is marked as lock protected, and henceforth not treated as transition
  boundary. If however the set should afterwards become empty, a warning like
  </p>
  <p class="code">Warning: unprotected field access of: Event@70.count in thread: "Thread-1" oldclassic.java:107
   sync-detection assumed to be protected by: Event@70
   found to be protected by: {}
   >>> re-run with 'vm.por.sync_detection=false' or exclude field from checks <<<
</p>

  <p>is issued, and the field access is again treated as transition breaker.</p>
  
  <p>The set of fields to be analyzed can be specified with the properties
  <tt>vm.por.include_fields</tt> and <tt>vm.por.exclude_fields</tt>. Per default,
  fields of system library classes are not analyzed (this is esp. useful to
  avoid context switches for global objects like <tt>System.out</tt>).
  
  <p>Even with all these optimizations, some unwanted transition breakers are
  likely to remain. This is mostly due to two constraints:
  <ul>
  <li>JPF only considers reachability, not accessibility</li> 
  <li>write once, read multiple conditions cannot be detected a priori for fields
  that are not final, or inside immutable objects (like java.lang.String)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Especially the last issue might be subject to further enhancements</p>
