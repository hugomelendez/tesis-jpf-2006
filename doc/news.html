<h1>JPF News</h1>

<ul>

<li>06/30/06: JPF v4, finally! After a long period of silence due to
other assignments, we finally pulled all the pieces together to get
JPF4 out of the door. The major achievements are 
<a href="ChoiceGenerators.html" target="content">ChoiceGenerators</a> and
Java 5.0 compatibility, but there are many others (numerous bug fixes,
reflection support, instruction interception etc.). Configurable state
management (esp. matching) is now also in the works - the last missing extension
mechanism. And while we were at it, a lot of the sources have been converted to
use Java 5.0. Great work by our summer interns, esp. Peter Dillinger.</li>

<li>24/02/06: Join the JPF community on Frappr:
http://www.frappr.com/jpfusers</li>

<li>10/21/05: the documentation is now readable HTML + CSS, which is
not so nice for printing, but everybody can edit and add. The whole
website (w/o experimental Wiki) is now in CVS, only the graphics
sources (which are OmniGraffle *.graffle files) are not. Maybe we
add them as SVGs at some point (but OminiGraffle doesn't load them
yet).</li>

<li>10/08/05: switched from MD5StateSet to Peter Dillinger's
JenkinsStateSet, which is up to 25% faster on some (large) examples.
Great contribution</li>

<li>09/08/05: the data choice generators make their first appearance.
Drop Verify.randomX(..) now</li>
  
<li>08/29/05: JPF should now be Java 1.5 compatible. There might be a
few surprises left in the libraries, but the regression test suite
builds and runs on J2SDK 1.5</li>

<li>08/24/05: The JPF tutorial at <a
href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/spin2005/">Spin 2005</a> drew
quite a crowd, despite the late hour on the last conference day</li>

<li>04/26/2005: Alast - JPF becomes the first NASA software opensource
project that is hosted on SourceForge! External interest had grown
enough that open sourcing just seemed to be the right step. JPF is still
a moving target, there are exciting ideas to extend it, and so NASA took
the bold step to not just open the sources, but to make further
development a collaborative effort. We have a first! Read the <a
href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/releases/2005/05_28AR.html">
official press announcement</a>. May JavaPathFinder boldly explore from
where no program has ever returned</li>

<li>03/2005: The move to the new configuration and initialization scheme
has been completed. Now everything is configured via a hierarchy of Java
property files that can be overridden from the command line, eliminating
the need to update a central option registry every time a new option is
added in a remote part of the system. Read the <a
href="$Configuring_JPF_Runtime_Options.html">online docu</a> to find out
more.</li>

<li>01/2005: The JPF Team will present a tool tutorial at the 12th
International SPIN Software Model Checking workshop in San Francisco
(August 2005). More details can be found <a
href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/spin2005/">here</a></li>

<li>11/2004: Fujitsu Labs of America successfully uses JPF to locate
subtle concurrency errors in parts of their enterprise software</li>

<li>08/2004: JPF Team receives a Certificate of Recognition for
"creative development of technically significant software" from NASA's
Inventions and Contributions board</li>

<li>09/2003: <a href="$Search-_and_VMListeners.html">Search- and
VMListeners</a> are added to the extension repertoire of JPF. Hopefully,
this will put an end to ever extending JPF's core classes. Now you can
add your own hyper-search algorithms and most favorite properties
outside the critical core</li>

<li>07/2003: The <a href="$The_Model_Java_Interface.html">Model Java
Interface</a> (MJI - blame Peter for the bad name) is added to the code
base. Now we can use the same mechanism for core class JPF interaction
and library abstractions (saving states on the way). Mind-twisted things
become possible with this</li>

<li>06/2003: Here comes another award - NASA Office of Aerospace
Technology awards JPF its "Turning Goals Into Reality" (TGIR)
Engineering Innovation Award. <a
href="http://itsr.cict.nasa.gov/ts_tgir-jpf.html" >Read on</a> </li>

<li>04/2003: First <a
href="http://sdg.lcs.mit.edu/pubs/2003/GSE.pdf">publication</a> on the
introduction of symbolic execution on top of JPF</li>

<li>04/2002: JPF tutorial at ETAPS 2002 in Grenoble, France</li>

<li>02/2001: JPF is released by NASA for beta-testing and project
collaborators</li>

<li>09/2000: Main conference paper on JPF published at International
Automated Software Engineering Conference ("Model Checking Programs").
It was considered for the best paper award, but narrowly lost out - it
has since become one of the most cited papers (>100) from the ASE
conference series according to <a
href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/">citeseer</a>. Journal version of
this <a
href="http://csdl.computer.org/comp/proceedings/ase/2000/0710/00/07100003abs.htm">
paper</a> is now available in the ASE journal</li>

<li>07/2000: First JPF paper published at "Advances in Verification"
workshop</li>

<li>12/1999: JPF gets it first outing in public during a presentation at
the LUACTS workshop in Johannesburg, South Africa</li>
