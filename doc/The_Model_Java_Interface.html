  <h1>The Model Java Interface</h1>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>

  <p>Even if it is just a Java application (i.e.
  solely consists of Java classes), JPF can be viewed as a Java
  Virtual Machine (JVM) in itself. The consequence is that
  (*.class) classfiles, and even the same files at times, are
  processed in two different ways in a JVM running JPF</p>

  <ul>
    <li>as ordinary Java classes managed and
    executed by the host JVM (standard Java library classes, JPF
    implementation classes)</li>

    <li>as "modeled" classes managed and processed
    (verified) by JPF</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Class lookup in both layers is based on the
  CLASSPATH environment variable / command line parameter, but this
  should not obfuscate the fact that we have to clearly distinguish
  between these two modes. In particular, JPF (i.e. the "Model"
  layer) has its own class and object model, which is completely
  different and incompatible to the (hidden) class and object
  models of the underlying host JVM executing JPF</p>

  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/jpf-layers.png" /><br>
       Figure 1: JPF Java layers</p>

  <p>Each standard JVM supports a so called "Java
  Native Interface" (JNI), that is used to delegate execution from
  the Java level (i.e. JVM controlled bytecode) down into the
  (platform dependent) native layer (machine code). This is
  normally used to interface certain functionalities to the
  platform OS / architecture (e.g. I/O or graphics).</p>

  <p>Interestingly enough, there exists a analogous
  need to lower the "execution" level in JPF, from JPF controlled
  bytecode into JVM controlled bytecode. According to this analogy,
  the JPF specific interface is called "Model Java interface"
  (MJI).</p>

  <p>Even though MJI offers a wide range of
  applications, there are three major usages for delegating
  bytecode execution into the host JVM:</p>

  <p><b>(1) Interception of native methods</b> - without a abstraction lowering
  mechanism, JPF would be forced to completely ignore native
  methods, i.e. would fail on applications relying on the side
  effects of such methods, which is not acceptable (even if&nbsp;
  many native methods indeed can be ignored if we restrict the set
  of verification targets)</p>

  <p><b>(2) Interfacing of JPF system level functionality</b> -
  some system level functions of standard library classes (esp.
  java.lang.Class, java.lang.Thread) have to be intercepted
  even if they are not native because they
  have to affect the JPF internal class, object and thread model
  (etc. loading classes, creating / starting threads). It should be
  noted that MJI can also be used to extend the functionality of
  JPF without changing its implementation.</p>

  <p><b>(3) State space reduction</b> - by
  delegating bytecode execution into the non-state-tracked host
  JVM, we can cut off large parts of the state space, provided that
  we know the corresponding method side effects are not relevant
  for property verification (e.g. System.out.println(..))</p>

  <p>Besided these standard usages, there exist more
  exotic applications like collecting information about JPF state
  space exploration and making it available both to JPF and the
  verification target.</p>

  <h2>MJI Components</h2>

  <p>The basic functionality of MJI consists of a
  mechanism to intercept method invocations, and delegate them by
  means of Java reflection calls to dedicated classes. There are
  two types of classes involved, residing in different layers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Model Class - this is the class executed
    by JPF, which might be completely unknown to the host JVM</li>

    <li>Native Peer Class - this is the class
    containing the implementations of the methods to intercept, and
    to execute in the host JVM</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As part of the JPF implementation, MJI
  automatically takes care of determining which method invocations
  have to be intercepted, looking up the corresponding</p>

  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/mji-functions.png" /><br>
       Figure 2: MJI functions</p>

  <p>But this would be not very useful without being
  able to access the JPF object model (or other JPF intrinsics),
  from inside the NativePeer methods. Instead of requiring all
  NativePeer implementations to reside in a JPF internal package,
  there exists a interface class MJIEnv that can be used to get
  back to JPF in a controlled way. NativePeers residing in
  gov.nasa.jpf.jvm (i.e. the same package like MJIEnv) can
  basically reach all internal JPF features. Outside this package,
  the available API in MJIEnv is mostly restricted to the access
  JPF object (getting and setting values).</p>

  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/mji-call.png" /><br>
       Figure 3: MJI call sequence</p>

  <p>Before a NativePeer method can be used, JPF has
  to establish the correspondence between the Model Class and the
  NativePeer. This takes place at load time of the Model Class. MJI
  uses a special name mangling scheme to lookup NativePeers, using
  the Model Class package name and class name to deduce the
  NativePeer class name.</p>

  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/MJI-mangling.png" /><br>
       Figure 4: MJI name mangling</p>

  <p>Since the model class package is encoded in the
  NativePeer class name, the package of the NativePeer can be
  choosen freely. In analogy to JNI, NativePeer method names
  include the signature of the model method by encoding its
  parameter types. If there is no potential ambiguity, i.e. mapping
  from NativePeer to model class methods is unique, signature
  encoding is not required.</p>

  <p>All native methods in a NativePeer have to be
  "public static" - there is no correspondence between JPF and JVM
  objects. Instead, MJI automatically adds two parameters: MJIEnv
  and objRef (classRef in case of static Model Class methods). The
  MJIEnv object can be used to get back to JPF, the objRef is a
  handle for the corresponding JPF "this" object (or the
  java.lang.Class object in case of a static method).</p>

  <p>Going beyond the JNI analogy, MJI can also be used to intercept</p>

  <ul>
    <li>non-native methods (i.e. the lookup
    process is driven by the methods found in the NativePeer, not
    the "native" attributes in the Model Class. This can be
    particularly useful in case the class is used from both as a
    Model Class and a JVM class (e.g. gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.Verify),
    using a method body that directly refers to the NativePeer
    class</li>
    
    <li>class initialization (the corresponding
    NativePeer method has to be named<br />
      $clinit (MJIEnv env, int clsRef)</li>

    <li>constructors (the corresponding method
    name stem has to be<br />
      $init__&lt;sig&gt;(MJIEnv env,int objRef,
      &lt;ctor-params&gt;)<br />
      (normal signature mangling rules apply)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It is important to note that type correspondence
  does NOT include references. All references (object types) on the
  JPF side are transformed in handles (int values) on the JVM side.
  The passed in MJIEnv parameter has to be used to convert/analyze
  the JPF object. Since MJI per default uses the standad Java
  reflection call mechanism, there is a significant speed penalty
  (lookup, parameter conversion etc.), which again is a analogy to
  JNI.</p>

  <p>Even if it is not directly related to MJI, it
  should be mentioned that some JPF specific Model Classes cannot
  be loaded via the CLASSPATH (e.g. java.lang.Class), since they
  contain JPF based code that is not compatible with the host JVM
  (e.g. relying on native methods that refer to JPF functionality).
  Such classes should be kept in separate directories / jars that
  are specified with the JPF command line option
  "-jpf-bootclasspath" or "-jpf-classpath". This is mostly the case
  for system classes. On the other hand, Model Classes don't have
  to be JPF specific. It is perfectly fine to provide a NativePeer
  for a standard Java class (e.g. java.lang.Character), if only
  certain methods from that standard class needs to be intercepted.
  NativePeer classes can contain any number of non-"native" methods
  and fields, but those should not be "public static" to avoid
  problems lookup problems.</p>

  <h2>Tools</h2>

  <p>To ease the tedious process of manually mangle
  method names, MJI includes a tool to automatically create
  skeletons of NativePeer classes from a given Model class, called
  "GenPeer". The translation process uses Java reflection, i.e. the
  Model Class needs to be in the CLASSPATH and is specified in
  normal dot notation (i.e. not as a file).</p>

  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/GenPeer.png" /><br>
       Figure 5: MJI GenPeer tool</p>

  <p>There exist a number of command line options that
  can be displayed by calling GenPeer without arguments. GenPeer
  per default writes to stdout, i.e. the output has to be
  redirected into a file.</p>

  <p>Since NativePeer method invocations impose a
  significant (reflection call) overhead, there exists a mechanism
  to bypass the JVM method dispatching and the parameter
  conversion, called "NativePeer Dispatcher". This is implemented
  as a completely transparent NativePeer proxy that can be
  automatically generated by means of the GenPeerDispatcher
  tool</p>

  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/GenPeerDispatcher.png" /><br>
       Figure 6: MJI GenPeerDispatcher tool</p>

  <p>Depending on further improvements of target JVMs,
  this might not be required in the future and should only be
  considered for performance critical methods. The generated
  dispatcher class has the same name like the corresponding
  NativePeer, with a "$" suffix. It is looked up via the standard
  CLASSPATH (i.e. should be kept in the same directory / archive
  like the NativePeer).</p>

  <h2>Example</h2>

  <p>The following example is an excerpt of a JPF
  regression test, showing how to intercept various different
  method types, and using MJIEnv to access JPF objects.</p>

  <p>Model class:</p>

  <p class="code">
  public class TestNativePeer {
    static int sdata;
    
    static {
      // only here to be intercepted
    }
    
    int idata;
    
    TestNativePeer (int data) {
      // only here to be intercepted

    }
  
    public void testClInit () {
      if (sdata != 42) {
        throw new RuntimeException("native 'clinit' failed");
      }
    }

    public void testInit () {
      TestNativePeer t = new TestNativePeer(42);

      if (t.idata != 42) {
        throw new RuntimeException("native 'init' failed");
      }
    }

    native int nativeInstanceMethod (double d, char c, boolean b, int i);

    public void testNativeInstanceMethod () {

      int res = nativeInstanceMethod(2.0, '?', true, 40);
      if (res != 42) {
        throw new RuntimeException("native instance method failed");
      }
    }
    
    native long nativeStaticMethod (long l, String s);

    public void testNativeStaticMethod () {
      long res =  nativeStaticMethod(40, "Blah");

      if (res != 42) {
        throw new RuntimeException("native instance method failed");

      }
    }
    
    native void nativeException ();
    
    public void testNativeException () {
      try {
        nativeException();
      } catch (UnsupportedOperationException ux) {
        String details = ux.getMessage();

        if ("caught me".equals(details)) {
          return;
        } else {
          throw new RuntimeException("wrong native exception details: " +
                                     details);
        }
      } catch (Throwable t) {
        throw new RuntimeException("wrong native exception type: " +
                                   t.getClass());
      }

      throw new RuntimeException("no native exception thrown");
    }

  }</p>

  <p>NativePeer class:</p>

  <p class="code">
  public class JPF_gov_nasa_jpf_jvm_TestNativePeer {

    public static void $clinit (MJIEnv env, int rcls) {
      env.setStaticIntField(rcls, "sdata", 42);
    }

    public static void $init__I (MJIEnv env, int robj, int i) {
      env.setIntField(robj, "idata", i);
    }

    public static int nativeInstanceMethod (MJIEnv env, int robj,
                                            double d, char c,
                                            boolean b, int i) {
      if ((d == 2.0) &amp;&amp; (c  == '?') &amp;&amp; b) {
        return i + 2;
      }
      return 0;
    }

    public static long nativeStaticMethod (MJIEnv env, int rcls,
                                           long l, int stringRef) {
      String s = env.getStringObject(stringRef);
      if ("Blah".equals(s)) {
        return l + 2;
      }
      return 0;
    }

    public static void nativeException (MJIEnv env, int robj) {
      env.throwException("java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException",
                         "caught me");
    }
