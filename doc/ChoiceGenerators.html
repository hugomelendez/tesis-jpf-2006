  <h1>ChoiceGenerators</h1>

  <p>Software model checking is all about doing the right choices, to reach the
  interesting system states within the resource constraints of the tool and 
  execution environment. We refer to the mechanism used by JPF to systematically
  explore the state space as <em>ChoiceGenerators</em>.
  
  <p>ChoiceGenerators can be approached from an application perspective, or
  from the JPF implementation perspective. We will do both.</p>
  
  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  
  <p>While most of the choices during JPF application are related to thread
  scheduling, the example that obviously justifies our implementation approach
  is from the non-deterministic data acquisition branch. Support for "random"
  data acquisition (using the <tt>gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.Verify</tt> interface) has
  been in JPF since a long time</p>
  
  <p class="code">...
boolean b = Verify.getBoolean(); // evaluated by JPF for both 'true' and 'false'
...
</p>

  <p>This worked nicely for small sets of choice values (like <tt>{true,false}</tt>
  for boolean), but the mechanism for enumerating all choices from a type specific
  interval becomes already questionable for large intervals (e.g. 
  <tt>Verify.getInt(0,10000)</tt>), and fails completely if the data type does
  not allow finite choice sets at all (like floating point types):</p>

  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/cg-motivation.png" /><br>
   Figure 1: ChoiceGenerator Motivation</p>

  <p>To handle this case, we have to leave the ideal world of model checking
  (that considers all possible choices), and make use of what we know about the
  real world - we have to use <em>heuristics</em> to make the set of choices
  finite and manageable. However, heuristics are application and domain specific,
  and it would be a bad idea to hardcode them into the test drivers we give JPF to
  analyze. This leads to a number of requirements for the JPF choice mechanism:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>choice mechanisms have to be decoupled (i.e. thread choices should be
    indpendent of data choices, double choices from int choices etc.)</li>
    
    <li>choice sets and enumeration should be encapsulated in dedicated, type
    specific objects. The VM should only know about the most basic types, and
    otherwise use a generic interface to obtain choices</li>
    
    <li>selection of classes representing (domain specific) heuristics, and
    parametrization of ChoiceGenerator instances should be possible at runtime,
    i.e. via JPF's configuration mechanism (properties)</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The diagram shown above depicts this with an example that uses a
  "randomly" chosen velocity value of type double. As an example heuristic we use
  a threshold model, i.e. we want to know how the system reacts below, at, and
  above a certain application specific value (threshold). We reduce an
  infinite set of choices to only three "interesting" ones. Of course,
  "interesting" is quite subjective, and we probably want to play with the
  values (delta, threshold, or even used heuristic) efficiently, without
  having to rebuild the application each time we run JPF.</p>

  <p>The code example does not mention the used ChoiceGenerator class 
  (<tt>DoubleThresholdGenerator</tt>) at all, it just specifies a symbolic name
  <tt>"velocity"</tt>, which JPF uses to look up an associated class name from its
  configuration data (initialized via property files or the command line - see
  <a href="Configuring_JPF_Runtime_Options.html" target="content">Configuring
  JPF Runtime Options</a>). But it doesn't stop there. Most heuristics need
  further parameterization (e.g. threshold, delta), and we provide that by
  passing the JPF configuration data into the ChoiceGenerator constructors (e.g.
  the <tt>'velocity.threshold'</tt> property). Each ChoiceGenerator instance
  knows its symbolic name (e.g. "velocity"), and can use this name to look up
  whatever parameters it needs.</p>
  
  <h2>The JPF Perspective</h2>
   
  <p>Having such a mechanism is nice for avoiding test driver modification. But it
  would be much nicer to consistently use the same mechanism not just for
  data acquisition choices, but also scheduling choices (i.e. functionality
  that is not controlled by the test application). JPF's ChoiceGenerator
  mechanism does just this, but in order to understand it from an implementation
  perspective we have to take one step back and look at JPF terminology:</p>
  
  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/cg-ontology.png" /><br>
   Figure 2: States, Transitions and Choices</p>
   
  <p><b>State</b> is a snapshot of the current execution status of the application
  (mostly thread and heap states), plus the execution history (path) that lead
  to this state. Every state has a unique id number. JPF-internally, State is
  encapsulated in the <tt>SystemState</tt> instance (almost, there is some
  execution history which is just kept by the JVM object). This includes three
  components:
  <ul>
  <li>KernelState - the application snapshot (threads, heap)</li>
  <li>trail - the last <em>Transition</em> (execution history)</li>
  <li>current and next ChoiceGenerator - the objects encapsulating the choice
  enumeration that produces different transitions (but not necessarily new states)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Transition</b> is the sequence of instructions that leads from one state
  to the next. There is no context switch within a transition, it's all in the same
  thread. There can be multiple transitions leading out of one state (but not
  necessarily to a new state).
  </ul></p>
  
  <p><b>Choice</b> is what starts a new transition. This can be a different thread
  (i.e. scheduling choice), or different "random" data value.</p>
  
  <p>In other words, possible existence of Choices is what terminates the last
  Transition, and selection of a Choice value precludes the next Transition. The
  first condition corresponds to creating a new ChoiceGenerator, and letting
  the SystemState know about it. The second condition means to query the next
  choice value from this ChoiceGenerator (either internally within the JVM, or
  in an instruction or native method).</p>
   
  <h2>How it comes to Life</h2>
   
  <p>With this terminology, we are ready to have a look at how it all works. Let's
  assume we are in a Transition that executes a <tt>get_field</tt> bytecode
  instruction (remember, JPF executes Java bytecode), and the corresponding
  object that owns this field is shared between threads. For simplicity's sake,
  let's further assume there is no synchronization when accessing this object, (or
  we have turned vm.sync_detection off). Let's also assume there are other runnable
  threads at this point. Then we have a choice - the outcome of the execution
  might depend on the order in which we schedule threads, and hence access this
  field. There might be a data race.</p>
  
  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/cg-sequence.png" /><br><br>
   Figure 3: ChoiceGenerator Sequence</p>

  <p>Consequently, when JPF executes this <tt>get_field</tt> instruction, the
  <tt>gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.bytecode.GET_FIELD.execute()</tt> method does three
  things:
  <ol>
  <li>create a new ChoiceGenerator (ThreadChoiceGenerator in this case), that
  has all runnable threads at this point as possible choices</li>
  <li>registers this ChoiceGenerator via calling
      <tt>SystemState.setNextChoiceGenerator()</tt></li>
  <li>schedules itself for reexecution (just returns itself as the next
  instruction to execute within the currently running thread)</li>
  </ol></p>
   
  <p>At this point, JPF ends this Transition (which is basically a loop inside
  <tt>ThreadInfo.executeStep()</tt>), stores a snapshot of the current State, and
  then starts the next Transition (let's ignore the Search and possible backtracks
  for a moment). The ChoiceGenerator created and registered at the end of the
  previous Transition becomes the new current ChoiceGenerator. Every State has
  exactly one current ChoiceGenerator object that is associated with it, and every
  Transition has exactly one choice value of this ChoiceGenerator that kicks
  it off. Every Transition ends in an Instruction that produces the next
  ChoiceGenerator.</p>
  
  <p>The new Transition is started by the SystemState by setting the previously
  registered ChoiceGenerator as the current one, and calling its
  <tt>ChoiceGenerator.advance()</tt> method to position it on its next choice.
  Then the SystemState checks if the current ChoiceGenerator is a
  <tt>SchedulingPoint</tt> (just a <tt>ThreadChoiceGenerator</tt> that is meant
  to be used for scheduling purposes), and if it is, gets the next thread
  to execute from it (i.e. the SystemState itself consumes the choice). Then it
  starts the next Transition by calling <tt>ThreadInfo.executeStep()</tt> on it.</p>
  
  <p>The <tt>ThreadInfo.executeStep()</tt> basically loops until an
  <tt>Instruction.execute()</tt> returns itself, i.e. has scheduled itself
  for reexecution with a new ChoiceGenerator. When a subsequent
  <tt>ThreadInfo.executeStep()</tt> reexecutes this instruction
  (e.g. <tt>GET_FIELD.execute()</tt>), the instruction notices that it is the
  first instruction in a new Transition, and hence does not have to create
  a ChoiceGenerator but proceeds with it's normal operations.</p>
  
  <p>If there is no next instruction, or the Search determins that
  the state has been seen before, the VM backtracks. The SystemState is restored
  to the old state, and checks for not-yet-explored choices of its associated
  ChoiceGenerator by calling <tt>ChoiceGenerator.hasMoreChoices()</tt>. If there
  are more choices, it positions the ChoiceGenerator on the next one by calling
  <tt>ChoiceGenerator.advance()</tt>. If all choices have been processed, the
  system backtracks again (until it's first ChoiceGenerator is done, at which
  point we terminate the search).
  
  <p class="big_diagram"><img src="JPF_files/cg-impl.png" /><br>
   Figure 4: ChoiceGenerator Implementation Aspects</p>
   
  <p>The methods that create ChoiceGenerators have a particular structure,
  dividing their bodies into two parts:
  <ul>
  <li><b>top half</b> - (potentially) creates and registers a new
  ChoiceGenerator</li>

  <li><b>bottom half</b> - which does the real work, and might depend on
  acquiring a new choice value</li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <p>The only difference between scheduling choices and data acqusition choices
  is that the first ones are handled internally by the JVM (more specifically:
  used by the <tt>SystemState</tt> to determine the next Thread to execute),
  and the data acqusition is handled in the bottom half of an
  <tt>Instruction.execute()</tt>, native method, or Listener callback method
  (in which case it has to acquire the current ChoiceGenerator from the
  SystemState, and then explicitly call <tt>ChoiceGenerator.getNextChoice()</tt>
  to obtain the choice value). For a real example, look at the
  <tt>JPF.gov_nasa_jpf_jvm_Verify.getBoolean()</tt> implementation.</p>
   
  <p>As an implementation detail, creation of SchedulingPoints are delegated
  to a <tt>SchedulerFactory</tt> object, which encalsulates a scheduling
  policy by providing a consistent set of ThreadChoiceGenerators for the fixed
  number of instructions that are scheduling relevant (<tt>monitor_enter</tt>,
  synchronized method calls, <tt>Object.wait()</tt> etc.). Clients of this
  SchedulerFactory therefore have to be aware of that the policy object might
  not return a new ChoiceGenerator, in which case the client directly proceeds
  with the bottom half execution, and does not break the current Transition.</p>
  
  <p>The standard classes and interfaces for the ChoiceGenerator mechanism can
  be found in package <tt>gov.nasa.jpf.jvm</tt>, and include:
  <ul>
  <li>ChoiceGenerator</li>
  <li>BooleanChoiceGenerator</li>
  <li>IntChoiceGenerator</li>
  <li>DoublechoiceGenerator</li>
  <li>ThreadChoiceGenerator</li>
  <li>SchedulingPoint</li>
  <li>SchedulerFactory</li>
  <li>DefaultSchedulerFactory</li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <p>Concrete implementations can be found in package <tt>gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.choice</tt>,
  and include classes like:
  <ul>
  <li>IntIntervalGenerator</li>
  <li>IntChoiceFromSet</li>
  <li>DoubleChoiceFromSet</li>
  <li>DoubleThresholdGenerator</li>
  <li>SchedulingChoiceFromSet</li>
  </ul></p>
  
  <p>As the number of useful generic heuristics increases, we expect this
  package to be populated and changed.</p>
