  <h1>JPF and Eclipse</h1>

  <p>JPF4 compiles and runs nicely inside of the <a href=
  "http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse IDE</a>.  Do NOT use "New Java Project"
  or "New Java Project from Existing Ant Buildfile".  These are difficult
  to get working for JPF.  Instead, if you have already checked out or
  downloaded JPF, use "Import..." "Existing Projects into Workspace"
  selecting the JPF root directory.  The project named
  "javapathfinder-trunk" should be available.</p>

  <p>With Subclipse installed
  (<a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">http://subclipse.tigris.org/</a>)
  one can download JPF inside of Eclipse using "Import..." "Checkout Projects
  from SVN".  The repository URL is
  <tt>https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/javapathfinder</tt> and the
  folder to check out is "<tt>trunk</tt>".  It's about that easy.</p>

  <p>The Compiler settings in either the project or
  the workspace Properties dialog should have the "JDK Compliance"
  (tab "Compliance and Classfiles", settings "compiler compliance
  level" "generated class files compatibility" and "source
  compatibility") set to "5.0".</p>

  <p>Beyond this, the only caveat for building and running JPF is
  the inclusion/exclusion of the env/jpf source directory. Classes compiled
  from this location are MJI model classes of standard Java library
  components that are only meant to be seen by JPF, not the host
  VM, and some problems can arise from this directory appearing in the
  Eclipse source path.  Specifically, Eclipse compiles the rest of the
  classes considering these model classes as global replacements for
  the standard Java conterparts, including classes such as java.lang.Class
  and java.lang.Thread.  For building, the model classes do
  not yet contain all the functions of the standard library classes, and
  for execution, the functionality is quite different: tailored to execution
  inside JPF.  On some machines and Eclipse versions (esp. under Windows),
  this might cause the Eclipse internal builder to abort silently!</p>
  
  <p>There are two solutions to this problem:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>remove env/jpf as a source directory in the build path.
    (this makes the model class sources unavailable when
    editing/compiling their native peer counterparts in env/jvm.)</li>

    <li>add missing model class methods and fields,
    so that Eclipse can build the JPF classes using these features.
    This may or may not break execution of JPF from within Eclipse, but
    it can be fixed with an explicit classpath for execution.
    Also, keep in mind that all JPF classes other than env/jpf will be
    executed by the host VM, and not JPF.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To run JPF from inside Eclipse, specify gov.nasa.jpf.JPF
  (RunJPF not recommended inside Eclipse) as the Main class
  inside the Run dialog (tab
  "Main"), use the default working directory (tab "Arguments"),
  specify the target application main class as the program
  argument, and make sure to include the project's default classpath
  (or a custom one to remove build/env/jpf)
  under user entries (tab "Classpath"). If the application under
  test resides outside the jpf directory tree, its class files of
  course have to be added to the user entries of the Classpath
  dialog tab.</p>
