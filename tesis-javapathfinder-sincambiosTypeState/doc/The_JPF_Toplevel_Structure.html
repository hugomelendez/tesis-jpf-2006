  <h1>The JPF Toplevel Structure</h1>

  <h2>Main Constructs</h2>
  <p>JPF was designed around two major abstractions:
  (1) the JVM, and (2) the Search object.</p>

  <p><b>(1)</b> The <b>JVM</b> is the Java specific state generator.
  By executing Java bytecode instructions, the JVM generates
  state representations that can be</p>

  <ul>
    <li>checked for equality (has a state been visited before)</li>
    <li>queried (thread states, data values etc.)</li>
    <li>stored</li>
    <li>restored</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The main JVM parameterizations are classes that implement
  the state management (matching, storing, backtracking). Most
  of the execution scheme is delegated to the <tt>SystemState</tt>,
  which in turn uses a <tt>SchedulerFactory</tt> (a factory object
  for <tt>ThreadChoiceGenerators</tt>) to generate scheduling sequences
  of interest.</p>
  
  <p>There are three major JVM methods in the context of the VM-Search
  collaboration</p>

  <ul>
    <li>forward - generate the next state, report
    if the generated state has a successor. If yes, store on a
    backtrack stack for efficient restoration.</li>

    <li>backtrack - restore the last state on the
    backtrack stack</li>

    <li>restoreState - restore an arbitrary state
    (not necessarily on the backtrack stack)</li>
  </ul>

       Figure 1: JPF toplevel structure</p>

  <p><b>(2)</b> The <b>Search</b> object is responsible for selecting the state from
  which the JVM should proceed, either by directing the JVM to generate the
  next state (forward), or by telling it to backtrack to a previously
  generated one. Search objects can be thought of as drivers for JVM objects.</p>

  <p>Search objects also configure and evaluate property objects (e.g.
  NotDeadlockedProperty, NoAssertionsViolatedProperty). The main Search
  implementations include a simple depth-first search (DFSearch), and a
  priority-queue based search that can be parameterized to do
  various search types based on selecting the most interesting
  state out of the collection of all successors of a given state
  (HeuristicSearch). A Search implementation mainly provides a
  single search method, which includes the main loop that iterates
  through the relevant state space until it has been completely
  explored, or the search found a property violation.</p>
  
  <h2>Package Structure</h2>
  <p>The JPF core is partitioned into three main packages and three support packages:</p>
  
  <p><b>gov.nasa.jpf</b> - the main responsibility of this package is configuration and
  instantiation of the core JPF objects, namely the <tt>Search</tt> and <tt>JVM</tt>.
  The configuration itself is delegated to the <tt>Config</tt> class, which contains
  various methods to create objects or read values from a hierarchy of property files
  and command line options (see <a href="Configuring JPF runtime options">Configuring
  JPF Runtime Options</a>). Beyond the configuration, the <tt>JPF</tt> object has little
  own functionality. It is mainly a convenience construct to start JPF from inside
  any Java application without having to bother with its complex configuration.</p>
  
  <p><b>gov.nasa.jpf.jvm</b> - constitutes the main body of code, including the
  various constructs that implement the Java state generator. Conceptually, the
  major class is <tt>JVM</tt>, but again this class delegates most of the work
  to a set of second level classes that together implement the major
  functionality of JPF. These classes can be roughly divided into three categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>class management - which starts with <tt>ClassInfo</tt>, but also contains
    the mostly execution state invariant information about fields and methods
    (<tt>FieldInfo</tt> and <tt>MethodInfo</tt>)</li>
    
    <li>object model - all object data in JPF is stored as integer arrays
    encapsulated by <tt>Fields</tt> objects. The execution specific lock
    state of objects is captured in <tt>Monitor</tt> instances. <tt>Fields</tt> and
    <tt>Monitor</tt> instances together form the objects, which are stored
    as <tt>ElementInfos</tt>. The heap (which is an <tt>Area</tt> instance) is
    just a dynamic array of <tt>ElementInfo</tt> objects, the array indices
    being used as object reference values</li>
    
    <li>bytecode execution - this is mostly a collaboration of <tt>SystemState</tt>
    and <tt>ThreadInfo</tt>, with some delegation to policy objects implementing
    the <a href="On-the-fly_Partial_Order_Reduction.html">Partial Order Reduction</a>.
    It starts with the JVM object calling <tt>SystemState.nextSuccessor()</tt>, which
    descends into <tt>ThreadInfo.executeStep</tt> (together, these two methods encalsupate
    the on-the-fly POR), which in turn calls <tt>ThreadInfo.executeInstruction()</tt>
    to perform the bytecode execution.<br>
    The actual execution is again delegated to bytecode specific <tt>Instruction</tt>
    instances that per default reside in a sub-package <tt>gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.bytecode</tt>
    (the set of bytecode classes to use can be configuredd via a <tt>InstructionFactory</tt>
    class)</li>    
  </ul></p>
  
  <p><b>gov.nasa.jpf.search</b> - is relatively small and mainly contains the 
  <tt>Search</tt> class, which is an abstract base for search policies. The
  major method that encapsulates the policy is <tt>Search.search()</tt>, which
  is the JVM driver (that calls <tt>forward()</tt>, <tt>backtrack()</tt> and
  <tt>restore()</tt>). This package also contains the plain-vanilla depth-first
  search policy <tt>DFSearch</tt>.<br>
  More interesting policies can be found in the sub-package
  <tt>gov.nasa.jpf.search.heuristic</tt>, which uses a <tt>HeuristicSearch</tt>
  class in conjunction with confgurable <tt>Heuristic</tt> objects to prioritize
  a queue of potential successor states</p>
