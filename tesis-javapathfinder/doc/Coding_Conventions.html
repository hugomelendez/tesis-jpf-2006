  <h1>Coding Conventions</h1>

  <p>JPF is an open system. In order to keep the
  source format reasonably consistent, we strive to keep the
  following minimal set of conventions</p>

  <ul>
    <li>2 space indentation (no tabs)</li>
    <li>opening brackets in same line (class
    declaration, method declaration, control statements)</li>
    <li>no spaces after opening '(', or before closing ')'</li>
    <li>method declaration parameters indent on column</li>
    <li>all files start with copyright and license information</li>
    <li>all public class and method declarations
    have preceding Javadoc comments</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following code snippet illustrates these rules.</p>

  <p class="code">
/* &lt;copyright notice goes here&gt;
 * &lt;license referral goes here&gt;
 */

/**
 * this is my class declaration example
 */
    
public class MyClass {
   
  /**
   * this is my public method example
   */
  public void foo (int arg1, int arg2,
                   int arg3) {
    if (bar) {
      ..
    } else {
      ..
    }
  }
   ..
}</p>

  <p>For convenience reasons, we include a jalopy.xml configuration
  file to format sources, but do not support it as a separate Ant
  target, to avoid accidental reformatting of a huge amount of CVS
  sources, and minimize dependencies for libraries required by the
  build process.</p>

  <p>We consider modularity to be of greater
  importance than source format. With its new configuration scheme,
  there is no need to introduce dependencies of core classes
  towards optional extensions anymore. If you add something that is
  optional, and does not seamlessly fit into an existing directory,
  keep it separate by adding new directories. The core JPF classes
  should not contain any additional dependencies to external
  code.</p>
