  <h1>The JPF Test System</h1>
  
  <p>As a complex runtime system for (almost) arbitrary Java programs, it goes
  without saying that JPF needs a solid set of regression tests. The test system
  is located in a separate <tt>test</tt> directory tree (see
  <a href="Directory_Structure.html" target="content">Directory Structure</a>),
  and contains two major branches:</p>
  
  <p><b>(1) core VM functionality</b> - this deals with standard JVM functions
  like class loading and initialization, field access, method invocation and
  exception handling. This is the most populated category of JPF tests, but
  still lacks a lot of coverage.</p>
  
  <p><b>(2) model checking functionality</b> - tests in this category should
  exercise JPF's state management, mostly state-storage, state-matching and
  backtracking. Other sub-categories especially include different search
  strategies. Counting the number of states (i.e. mostly partial order reduction
  testing) will be another emphasis (that hasn't been started yet).</p>
  
  <p>All tests follow the same scheme, which is motivated by the need to run
  tests in a number of different ways:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>as part of the Ant-based build system</li>
  <li>as explicitly invoked JUnit tests</li>
  <li>by directly running JPF on the test application (i.e. without JUnit)</li>
  <li>by running the test application on a normal JVM</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The rationale for this is to support various levels of inspection and
  debugging. Consequently, each test is separated into a JUnit test driver and a
  corresponding raw test</p>

       Figure 1: regression test structure</p>

  <p><b>(1) Junit test driver</b> - this test component runs JPF on the
  raw test, and uses JUnit to report the outcome of the test run (so that the
  test can be part of an automatically executed test suite). This involves three
  tasks for the programmer</p>
  <ol>
  <li>derive the driver from <tt>gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.TestJPF</tt>
  <p class="code">public class MyTestJPF <b>extends gov.nasa.jpf.jvm.TestJPF</b>
  {..}</p></li>
  
  <li>write a <tt>main()</tt> method that uses <tt>JUnitCore</tt> to execute
  the test
  <p class="code">public static void main (String[] args) {
  <b>JUnitCore.main("MyTestJPF")</b>;
}</p></li>
  
  <li>add one or several test methods that (a) are marked as <tt>@Test</tt>
  annotations (so that Junit can identify them), (b) specifies the JPF
  startup arguments (options, test class, test method(s)), and (c) starts JPF
  via the appropriate TestJPF method (that reflects the expected outcome)
  <p class="code">@Test  <b>//(a)</b>
public void testX (){
  String[] args = { "vm.finalize=true", "MyTest", "testX" }; <b>//(b)</b>
  runJPFException(args, "java.lang.NullPointerException");  <b>//(c)</b>
}</p>Usually, the raw test application method to be analyzed is named like
this method itself (e.g. <tt>testX()</tt>, but this is only a convention</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><b>(2) Raw test application</b> - this is a normal Java program that is
  to be execued by JPF. There are only two design constraints</p>
  <ol>
  <li>it should have a main function that allows explicit test (instance) method
  invocation based on provided arguments
  <p class="code">public static void main (String[] args) {
  MyTest t = new MyTest();
  ..
    if ("testX".equals(args[i])
      t.testX();
  ..
}</p></li>
  
  <li>it has to define the test methods referred to in the Junit test driver and
  the main function
  <p class="code">public void testX() {..}</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>While there is no strict need to have a 1:1 correspondence of test driver
  and raw test class, this scheme is used in existing JPF tests. The driver
  usually has the same name like the raw test class with an <tt>..JPF</tt>
  suffix.</p>
  
  <p>Execution of the whole test suite is done via the provided Ant
  <tt>build.xml</tt> script, target <tt>run-tests</tt> (see
  <a href="Building_JPF_from_the_Command_Line" target="content">Building JPF from
  the Command Line</a>). If the test driver should run stand alone, the user has
  to make sure that JPF and JUnit are in the classpath. There are no caveats if
  running the raw test application either via JPF or directly.</p>

  <p class="comment">Please note that as of 07/01/2006, the stable Ant release
  v1.6.5 does not handle JUnit 4.1 tests. In order to use JPFs JUnit 4.1
  based regression tests, you have to use a more recent Ant version
  (e.g. from http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/core/trunk). For your
  convenience, we provide such a snapshot in build-tools/lib</p>
