error: no accept labels defined in model (for option -a)
Valid Options are:
	-a  find acceptance cycles
	-A  ignore assert() violations
	-b  consider it an error to exceed the depth-limit
	-cN stop at Nth error (defaults to -c1)
	-d  print state tables and stop
	-e  create trails for all errors
	-E  ignore invalid end states
	-f  add weak fairness (to -a or -l)
	-hN use different hash-seed N:1..32
	-i  search for shortest path to error
	-I  like -i, but approximate and faster
	-J  reverse eval order of nested unlesses
	-l  find non-progress cycles -> disabled, requires compilation with -DNP
	-mN max depth N steps (default=10k)
	-n  no listing of unreached states
	-q  require empty chans in valid end states
	-r  read and execute trail - can add -v,-n,-PN,-g,-C
	-rN read and execute N-th error trail
	-C  read and execute trail - columnated output (can add -v,-n)
	-PN read and execute trail - restrict trail output to proc N
	-g  read and execute trail + msc gui support
	-T  create trail files in read-only mode
	-tsuf replace .trail with .suf on trailfiles
	-V  print SPIN version number
	-v  verbose -- filenames in unreached state listing
	-wN hashtable of 2^N entries(defaults to -w19)
null
